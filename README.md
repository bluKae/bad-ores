# Bad Ores

Just when you thought there were no good mods left in the world of Minecraft, Bad Ores comes along and conclusively confirms your views.

Bad Ores brings 39 unique ores to the table, each of which likely will take you by surprise. Some of which may or may not include intentionally crashing your game.

This mod is a port of the [1.7.10 version](https://github.com/diesieben07/Modjam-4) by diesieben07. It was originally created in 96 hours for ModJam 4, but the port took a lot more time than that.
